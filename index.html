  	<p>I love video games. I've spent a good chunk of my life exploring all sorts of video games from casual games to FPS shooters to others. I think they're all great in their own right, but I do have a few personal favorites.</p>

  	<h3>A list of some of my favorite games:</h3>

  	<ul>
  		<li>Valorant. 	I've been made fun of a lot for liking valorant but I couldn't care less. I've spent a lot of time on the game and managed to get to the top 2% of it, and I don't regret a minute I've spent on it. Graphically, it has more of a comic style more than a realistic one, but it is undeniably a beautiful game. It is a tactical 5v5 FPS shooter, and it definitely isn't for everyone, but it speaks to me.</li>
  		<br>
  		<li>Minecraft. 	Minecraft has been a controversial game but considering it is currently the most sold video game ever, the public seems to be in agreement that this game is a classic. The graphics are normally the biggest critisizm people have regarding minecraft, and I can see why to some extent. It's a pixelated game with wonky physics with not much in the aesthetics department, but for me and a lot of other people, that's what makes it so memorable. There's nothing else like it.</li>
  		<br>
  		<li>The Old R6S.	Rainbow Six Siege. Ah, the memories. My middle school and early high school years were practically made by this game. The friends I made, the times I had. A game that.. once was. I miss old R6. It is similar to Valorant in the fact that it's a tactical 5v5 shooter, and it was unlike any other game I had played. It felt very real. The graphics were real, the strategy you had to implement was real, the gadgets and utility was just as important as gunplay. The maps were beautiful and unique. The game is now a shadow of what it once was, as they kept changing all the maps, and they decided to make all the characters much less fun. And their anticheat is terrible.</li>
  	</ul>

  	<h3>Stuff I'd like to learn in this class</h3>

  	<ul>
  		<li>Unreal. Unreal. Unreal. That is the absolute top thing I'd like to learn, it isn't even a competition. I don't even know how to emphasize that further I just really want to learn Unreal Engine 4 or 5 but preferably 5 because it is newer and even though it is still in early access it would be very good to get a jump start on it due to it's several advantages over Unreal Engine 4.</li>
  		<br>
  		<li>Any kind of 3d work in any form. Even if its just.. learning how to place cubes down and making a premade character jump over them. I love working in 3d, and although I know that could be more advanced than what the rest of the class is capable of, it would be great in my own personal interest.</li>
  		<br>
  		<li>Really, there isn't much else I'd like. I'd like to support the rest of the students and act as a good TA, and I expect nothing less from myself than a 100% however I can.
  	</ul>
